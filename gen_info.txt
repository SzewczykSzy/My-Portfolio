Frontend
	React: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It's highly versatile and works well with other tools.
	Next.js: A React framework that provides server-side rendering and static site generation, enhancing performance and SEO.
	Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework that allows you to create a custom design quickly. It also has built-in dark mode support.
Backend
	Node.js with Express.js: A powerful backend framework for creating RESTful APIs. It will handle the backend logic and database operations.
	Firebase: Free tier for hosting, authentication, and real-time database. Firebase can also handle static file hosting.
Data Storage
	MongoDB Atlas: A free cloud-based NoSQL database service. It's highly scalable and works well with Node.js applications.
	Firebase Firestore: An alternative if you prefer to keep everything under the Firebase ecosystem.
CI/CD
	GitHub Actions: Automate your workflows directly from GitHub, including CI/CD pipelines.
	Vercel: Perfect for deploying Next.js applications. It integrates seamlessly with GitHub and offers automatic deployments.
Data Science Models
	TensorFlow.js: For running your TensorFlow models directly in the browser.
	Python (Flask or FastAPI): Serve more complex models via a REST API if they can't be run in the browser.
Strava Integration
	Strava API: Access your Strava activities. You can fetch data periodically using GitHub Actions.
	Pixela: Use Pixela for creating and tracking progress graphs.

Project Structure
	Home View: Introduction and navigation.
	About View: Information about you, your background, and skills.
	Stats View: Display stats from Kaggle, HackerRank, etc. Fetch this data using their respective APIs.
	CV View: Provide a link to your CV, which opens in a new tab.
	Projects View: Showcase your data science and other projects. Integrate TensorFlow models for demonstrations.
Dark and White Mode
	Tailwind CSS: Provides an easy way to toggle between dark and light modes.



Implementation Steps
	Initialize Repository

		Set up a GitHub repository with main and dev branches.
		Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD.
		Set Up Frontend

	Initialize a Next.js project.

		Configure Tailwind CSS for styling.
		Implement navigation and views for Home, About, Stats, CV, and Projects.
		Implement dark/light mode toggle.

	Set Up Backend

		Set up an Express.js server.
		Integrate with MongoDB Atlas or Firebase Firestore for data storage.
		Create RESTful endpoints to fetch data from APIs (Kaggle, HackerRank, Strava).

	Integrate TensorFlow Models

		Use TensorFlow.js for models that can run in the browser.
		For more complex models, use Flask or FastAPI to serve them via REST APIs.

	Strava Integration

		Set up a GitHub Action to periodically fetch data from the Strava API and store it in your database.
		Use Pixela to display progress graphs.
		Deploy Application

	Deploy the frontend to Vercel.

		Deploy the backend to Heroku (free tier) or another free hosting service.
		Ensure CI/CD pipelines are correctly set up for automatic deployments on push.

	Testing

		Thoroughly test each component and the integration.
		Ensure the app works seamlessly in both dark and light modes.

	Documentation

		Write clear documentation for the project, including setup instructions and how to contribute.
